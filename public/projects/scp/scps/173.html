            <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
            <p>Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.</p>
            <p>Object is to be kept in a sealed container, constructed primarily of reinforced concrete, measuring 200m x 200m x 200m. Cleaning should be done once every two weeks with any standard cleaning agents using traditional methods. Any waste products are to be removed immediately and the interior of the container must remain completely dry at all times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Origin is as yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must be broken before SCP-173 can move again.</p>
            <p>Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures.</p>
            <p>Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL supervisor on duty.</p>
            <div class="notice">Note: Personnel should exercise extreme caution when approaching or handling SCP-173. Multiple casualties have resulted from failure to follow containment procedures.</div>
