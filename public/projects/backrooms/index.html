                            a constant, maddening hum that never ceases. The wallpaper, a sickly yellow reminiscent of 
                            jaundiced skin, seems to stretch endlessly in all directions. The air is thick with the smell
                            of damp carpet and mold.

                            their contents obscured by shadows. The concrete floor is stained with unknown substances, and the 
                            air carries a metallic tang. The ceiling disappears into darkness above, occasionally broken by 
                            dim, swinging lights.

                            Rusted forklifts and broken pallets create obstacles in your path. Between the shelves, shadows seem 
                            to move with purpose, always just at the edge of your vision. The air grows colder as you venture deeper.
